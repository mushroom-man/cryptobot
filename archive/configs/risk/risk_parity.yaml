# CryptoBot Risk Parity Sizing Configuration
# =============================================
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for position sizing parameters.
#
# These values are from the validated backtest (16state_combined_backtest.py)
# which achieved:
#   - Annual Return: +113.9%
#   - Sharpe Ratio: 2.84
#   - Max Drawdown: 16.8%
#   - Calmar Ratio: 6.77
#
# DO NOT MODIFY without re-running backtest validation.

# =============================================================================
# TRADING PAIRS (Validated Set)
# =============================================================================
# These pairs were selected through backtesting and have sufficient liquidity
# and data history for the 16-state strategy.

# =============================================================================
# EXPOSURE LIMITS
# =============================================================================
# Control overall portfolio leverage and risk.

max_exposure: 2.0              # Maximum total exposure (2.0 = 200% of equity)
                               # Higher = more aggressive, more risk

min_exposure_floor: 0.40       # Minimum exposure even in worst drawdown
                               # Prevents going completely flat

# =============================================================================
# VOLATILITY TARGETING
# =============================================================================
# Scale position sizes to target consistent portfolio volatility.

target_vol: 0.40               # Target annualized portfolio volatility (40%)
                               # Higher = accept more volatility for more return

vol_lookback_months: 1         # Months of history for realized vol calculation
                               # 1 month = responsive, 3 months = smoother

# =============================================================================
# WEIGHT CALCULATION
# =============================================================================
# Parameters for calculating inverse-volatility weights.

cov_lookback_months: 2         # Months of history for weight calculation
                               # Longer = more stable weights, less responsive

min_weight_samples: 20         # Minimum daily samples needed for weight calc
                               # Below this, use equal weights as fallback

# =============================================================================
# DRAWDOWN PROTECTION
# =============================================================================
# Reduce exposure as drawdown increases to limit losses.

dd_start_reduce: -0.20         # Start reducing exposure at -20% drawdown
                               # Above this, full exposure allowed

dd_full_reduce: -0.50          # Maximum reduction at -50% drawdown
                               # At this level, exposure = min_exposure_floor

min_trade_size: 100.0          # Minimum trade size in USD
                               # Avoid tiny trades that cost more than benefit
